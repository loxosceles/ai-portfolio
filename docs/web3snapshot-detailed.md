# Web3 Snapshot Dashboard - Technical Portfolio Documentation

## Project Overview

The Web3 Snapshot Dashboard is a production-ready full-stack application that provides real-time cryptocurrency market analysis and visualization. Built with modern web technologies and containerized architecture, it demonstrates expertise in real-time data processing, microservices design, and responsive web development.

## Problem Statement & Solution

**Challenge**: Cryptocurrency markets move rapidly with constant price fluctuations and market cap changes. Traders and investors need real-time access to comprehensive market data, tokenomics analysis, and historical trends in an easily digestible format.

**Solution**: A containerized dashboard application that fetches live data from CoinGecko API, processes complex financial calculations, and delivers real-time updates through Server-Sent Events with an intuitive React interface supporting both standalone and embedded usage.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

**Frontend (React SPA)**

- Modern React 18 with functional components and hooks
- Responsive SCSS styling with modular component architecture
- Real-time data updates via Server-Sent Events
- Interactive data tables with sorting, filtering, and modal overlays
- Iframe embedding support for external integration

**Backend API (Flask)**

- RESTful API with Redis caching layer
- Real-time data streaming endpoints using Server-Sent Events
- Pub/sub messaging system for live updates
- Environment-specific configurations (development/production)

**Data Processing Engine (Python)**

- Automated data fetching from CoinGecko API
- Complex financial calculations (MC/FDV ratios, percentage changes)
- Intelligent data diffing to minimize unnecessary updates
- Cron-based scheduling for continuous market monitoring

**Infrastructure**

- Multi-container Docker architecture with service isolation
- Redis for high-performance caching and pub/sub messaging
- SQLite database with comprehensive schema design
- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL/TLS support

### Key Technical Features

**Real-Time Data Streaming**

```python
@bp.route("/coin-stream", methods=["GET"])
def get_coin_stream():
    redis_conn = current_app.redis_conn
    pubsub = redis_conn.pubsub(ignore_subscribe_messages=True)
    pubsub.subscribe("coins")
    return Response(event_stream(redis_conn, pubsub), mimetype="text/event-stream")
```

Implements Server-Sent Events for real-time market data updates without polling overhead.

**Intelligent Data Processing**

- Automated MC/FDV ratio calculations for tokenomics analysis
- Percentage change computations across multiple timeframes (1h, 24h, 7d, 30d, 1y)
- Data normalization and diff algorithms to optimize cache updates
- Rotating coin detail fetching system for comprehensive coverage

**Responsive Component Architecture**

- Modular React components with state management via Zustand
- Custom hooks for scroll locking and iframe detection
- Dynamic table rendering with overlay visualizations
- Mobile-responsive design with breakpoint management

## Technology Stack & Tools

**Frontend Technologies**

- **React 18**: Modern functional components with hooks and context
- **SCSS/Sass**: Modular styling with variables and mixins
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management for real-time data
- **React Router**: Client-side routing with nested route support
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API communication

**Backend Technologies**

- **Flask 3.0**: Lightweight Python web framework
- **Gunicorn**: WSGI HTTP server for production deployment
- **Redis 7.2**: In-memory caching and pub/sub messaging
- **RQ**: Redis-based job queue for background processing

**Data & Infrastructure**

- **SQLite**: Embedded database for persistent storage
- **Docker**: Multi-stage containerization with Alpine Linux
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy and static file serving
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

**Development Tools**

- **iPython**: Interactive development environment
- **Pytest**: Comprehensive test suite with fixtures
- **Pre-commit**: Code quality enforcement with linting
- **Black**: Python code formatting

## Architecture Patterns

**Microservices Design**: Separate containers for frontend, backend, database processing, and caching, enabling independent scaling and deployment.

**Event-Driven Architecture**: Redis pub/sub system decouples data processing from API responses, ensuring real-time updates across all connected clients.

**Repository Pattern**: Clean separation between data access, business logic, and presentation layers with dedicated utility modules.

**Observer Pattern**: Server-Sent Events implementation allows multiple clients to receive real-time updates without maintaining persistent connections.

## Performance & Scalability

**Caching Strategy**

- Redis-based caching with intelligent cache invalidation
- Data diffing algorithms reduce unnecessary database writes
- Rotating coin detail system optimizes API rate limiting

**Real-Time Optimization**

- Server-Sent Events eliminate polling overhead
- Pub/sub messaging ensures instant updates across all clients
- Efficient data normalization reduces payload sizes

**Container Optimization**

- Multi-stage Docker builds minimize image sizes
- Alpine Linux base images reduce attack surface
- Volume mounting for development hot-reloading

## Quality Assurance

**Testing Strategy**

- Backend unit tests with pytest and fixtures
- Frontend component testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration tests for API endpoints and data processing
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

**Code Quality**

- Pre-commit hooks with Black formatting and linting
- TypeScript configuration for enhanced development experience
- Modular component architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Deployment & Operations

**Container Orchestration**

- Docker Compose configurations for development and production
- Environment-specific service configurations
- Automated SSL certificate management with Certbot
- Health checks and restart policies for reliability

**Monitoring & Maintenance**

- Cron-based data fetching with error logging
- Redis persistence configuration for data durability
- Log rotation and cleanup automation
- Development container with iPython for debugging

**Security Features**

- Environment variable management for sensitive data
- Nginx security headers and SSL/TLS configuration
- Container isolation with dedicated networks
- Input validation and sanitization

## Future Enhancements

The modular architecture supports easy extension for additional cryptocurrency exchanges, advanced charting capabilities, portfolio tracking features, and mobile application development. The containerized approach enables deployment on cloud platforms like AWS ECS or Kubernetes.

This project demonstrates proficiency in modern full-stack development, real-time data processing, containerization, and production-ready application architecture suitable for high-traffic financial applications.
