# AI Portfolio Frontend - Detailed Overview

## Project Summary

The AI Portfolio Frontend is a modern, serverless web application that showcases a developer's professional profile with AI-powered personalization features. It uses a combination of Next.js for the frontend and AWS services for the backend, creating a seamless, dynamic portfolio experience that adapts to each visitor.

## Architecture

The project follows a modern cloud-native architecture with these key components:

### Frontend Architecture

- **Next.js Application**: Built with React 19 and TypeScript
- **Apollo Client**: For GraphQL data fetching and state management
- **TailwindCSS**: For responsive, utility-first styling
- **Centralized Auth Context**: Single source of truth for authentication state
- **Local Development Interceptor**: Generic mocking system for local development
- **Environment-Aware Authentication**: Different auth strategies per environment

### Backend Architecture

- **AWS AppSync**: GraphQL API with multiple authentication methods
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions for business logic
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for storing portfolio data
- **Amazon Bedrock**: AI service for generating personalized content
- **S3 & CloudFront**: Static hosting with global CDN

### Infrastructure as Code

- **AWS CDK**: Defines all cloud resources in TypeScript
- **Multi-stack approach**: Separation of concerns between API, Web, and Shared resources
- **Environment-based deployments**: Support for dev/prod environments

## Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Personalization

The system uses AI to create personalized experiences for recruiters and visitors:

- **Personalized Greetings**: AI-generated introductions based on the visitor's company and role
- **Job Matching**: Automatically highlights relevant skills and projects based on job descriptions
- **AI Q&A System**: Allows visitors to ask questions about the developer's experience using Amazon Bedrock with a simple 10-line prompt (to be enhanced)

### 2. Unique Link Generation

The portfolio includes a link generator tool that creates personalized access links:

- **Company-specific URLs**: Each recruiter gets a unique link with their company context
- **Context Preservation**: The system remembers who is visiting and customizes content accordingly
- **Analytics**: Tracks link usage and engagement metrics

### 3. Cost-Optimized Serverless Architecture

The application uses a sophisticated multi-region deployment strategy designed for minimal operational costs:

- **Static S3 Deployment**: Frontend assets hosted on S3 with near-zero storage costs
- **Global Content Delivery**: CloudFront CDN with pay-per-request pricing model
- **Serverless Backend**: Lambda functions and AppSync that only incur costs when used
- **Regional API**: Backend services deployed to EU region for data residency compliance
- **Cross-Region Communication**: Secure data flow between regions with proper IAM permissions
- **Minimal Operational Overhead**: No servers to maintain, patch, or scale

### 4. Invisible Authentication & Security

The portfolio implements a sophisticated security model without requiring visitors to log in:

- **Tokenized Links**: Each personalized URL contains a secure token tied to a virtual Cognito user
- **Content Isolation**: Visitors can only access personalized content intended specifically for them
- **Tamper-Proof Design**: URL manipulation is prevented through backend authentication checks
- **Seamless Experience**: Security measures operate invisibly with no login screens or credentials

### 5. Advanced Developer Experience

The project implements modern development practices:

- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized with pnpm workspaces for frontend and infrastructure
- **Comprehensive CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipeline with environment variable management
- **Code Quality Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, and Husky pre-commit hooks
- **Development Container**: Reproducible development environment with VS Code devcontainer

## Technical Implementation Details

### GraphQL API Design

The API is built with AWS AppSync and includes these main types:

- **Developer**: Core profile information with skills and projects
- **Project**: Portfolio projects with detailed information
- **JobMatching**: Personalization data for recruiter-specific experiences
- **AIResponse**: Structure for AI-generated content

### Authentication & Security

#### Centralized Authentication Architecture

The application uses a centralized auth context that provides:

- **Single Source of Truth**: All components use the same auth state
- **Environment Detection**: Automatic detection of local/dev/prod environments
- **Smart Header Generation**: Appropriate auth headers based on route type and environment
- **Token Caching**: Efficient token management with periodic refresh
- **Local Development Mocking**: Generic interceptor for offline development

#### Authentication Methods

Multiple authentication methods are supported:

- **API Key**: For public, read-only access to general portfolio content
- **Cognito User Pools**: For authenticated access with JWT tokens
- **IAM**: For secure backend-to-backend communication
- **Local Interceptor**: Mock responses for local development

#### Secure Personalization

The system implements authentication without requiring visitors to log in:

- **Virtual User Accounts**: Each personalized link is associated with a virtual user in Cognito
- **Token-based Access**: Links contain secure tokens that authenticate the visitor to their specific personalized content
- **Information Isolation**: Prevents visitors from accessing personalized content intended for others
- **Tamper Prevention**: URL parameter manipulation is ineffective as authentication is tied to backend Cognito identities

This approach ensures that personalized greetings, job-specific content, and cover letters are only visible to their intended recipients, while maintaining a seamless user experience with no visible login process.

### Data Flow

1. **Visitor Access**: User visits with a unique link containing a token
2. **Context Retrieval**: System loads personalization data from DynamoDB
3. **AI Enhancement**: Content is dynamically enhanced with AI-generated text
4. **Data Presentation**: GraphQL resolvers combine data from multiple sources
5. **Frontend Rendering**: Next.js components display the personalized portfolio

### Deployment Strategy

The project uses a sophisticated deployment approach:

- **Infrastructure First**: CDK deploys all backend resources
- **Environment Synchronization**: Environment variables are extracted from deployed resources
- **Frontend Build**: Next.js application is built with the correct environment variables
- **S3 Deployment**: Built assets are uploaded to S3
- **Cache Invalidation**: CloudFront cache is invalidated to ensure fresh content

### Cost Efficiency

The architecture is specifically designed to minimize operational costs:

- **Pay-Per-Use Model**: Services like Lambda, AppSync, and DynamoDB only incur costs when used
- **S3 Static Hosting**: Near-zero storage costs for frontend assets
- **Free Tier Utilization**: Many components operate within AWS Free Tier limits
- **Auto-Scaling**: Resources scale down to zero when not in use
- **No Server Maintenance**: Elimination of costs associated with running and maintaining servers
- **Estimated Monthly Cost**: Less than $5/month for typical portfolio usage patterns

## Planned Features

1. **Company Website Scraping**: A foundational data gathering mechanism that will:

   - Automatically analyze company websites and job postings
   - Extract key requirements, company values, and position details
   - Create a structured knowledge base relating job requirements to the developer's skills
   - Feed enriched context to all AI-powered features in the system
   - Enhance personalized greetings with company-specific information and terminology

2. **Enhanced AI Q&A System**: Building upon the current simple prompt by:

   - Incorporating the rich context from website scraping
   - Creating a comprehensive database of professional information
   - Enabling more precise and relevant answers about the developer's experience

3. **Dual-Purpose Cover Letter Generation**: When creating a personalized link for a specific job application, the system will:
   - Use scraped job details to generate a tailored cover letter matching skills to requirements
   - Provide this cover letter to the developer for use in their application
   - Store the cover letter and associate it with the personalized link
   - Automatically display this cover letter to the recruiter when they visit using their unique link

## Feature Integration

The planned features are designed to work together in an integrated system:
